# Airbnb New User Bookings Project

## Overview 
Since 2008, an increasing number of travelers have chosen to book their accommodation through Airbnb instead of traditional hotels. Through analyzing new usersâ€™ data, Airbnb can personalize and prioritize recommendations and advertisements for each user to provide better services.

After cleaning, transformation, and joining the `user` and `session` datatsets, we acquired a dataset of 34074 rows and 20 columns. We trained and made predictions with three models:   
* _Naive Bayes_  
* _Random Forest_  
* _Multinomial Logistic Regression_ 

## Description of Repository  
The structure of the repository are arranged into the following way:  
* **Code**: this folder stores the R codes of analysis    
  * [Data_Cleaning_and_EDA](https://github.com/yelselmiao/Airbnb-New-User-Bookings/blob/master/Code/Data_Cleaning_and_EDA.Rmd): this notebook contains the code of the data cleaning and transforming of the `user` and `session` datatsets, as well as some exploratory analysis    
  * [multinomial_logit.Rmd](https://github.com/yelselmiao/Airbnb-New-User-Bookings/blob/master/Code/multinom_logit.Rmd): this notebook stores the codes of training and predicting with multinomial logistic regression  
  * [Naive_Bayes.Rmd](https://github.com/yelselmiao/Airbnb-New-User-Bookings/blob/master/Code/Naive_Bayes.Rmd): this notebook stores the codes of training and predicting with naive Bayes classifiers    
  * [RandomForest.Rmd](https://github.com/yelselmiao/Airbnb-New-User-Bookings/blob/master/Code/RandomForest.Rmd): this notebook stores the codes of training and predicting with random forest models  
  * [helper_function.R](https://github.com/yelselmiao/Airbnb-New-User-Bookings/blob/master/Code/helper_function.R): this R script contains the helper/wrapper functions of our analysis   
  * [modeling_function.R](https://github.com/yelselmiao/Airbnb-New-User-Bookings/blob/master/Code/modeling_function.R): this R script contains the some helper functions specifically for the modeling process  

* **Data**: this folder stores the data and modeling outcomes:  
  * `airbnb_cleaned.Rdata`: the final cleaned dataset  
  * `rf_results.RData`: the results of the random forest models  
  * `rfe_1.Rdata`, `rfe_2.Rdata`, `rfe_3.Rdata`, `rfe_4.Rdata`, and `rfe_5.Rdata`: the random forest recursive feature elimination object for each fold  
  * `train_users_2.csv`: the original `user` dataset  

* **Figures**: some plots of visualizations  
* **Presentation**: slides of the presentation
