# Airbnb New User Bookings Project

## Overview 
Since 2008, an increasing number of travelers have chosen to book their accommodation through Airbnb instead of traditional hotels. Through analyzing new usersâ€™ data, Airbnb can personalize and prioritize recommendations and advertisements for each user to provide better services. The Kaggle competition can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/overview). 

After cleaning, transformation, and joining the `user` and `session` datatsets, we acquired a [cleaned dataset](\Data\airbnb_cleaned.Rdata) of 34074 rows and 20 columns. We trained and made predictions with three kinds of models:   
* _Naive Bayes_  
* _Random Forest_  
* _Multinomial Logistic Regression_ 

## Description of Repository  
The structure of the repository is arranged into the following way:  
* **Code**: this folder stores the R codes of analysis    
  * [1_Data_Cleaning_and_EDA](https://github.com/yelselmiao/Airbnb-New-User-Bookings/blob/master/Code/Data_Cleaning_and_EDA.Rmd): this notebook contains the codex of the data cleaning and transformation for the `user` and `session` datatsets, as well as some exploratory analysis    
  * [2_Naive_Bayes.Rmd](https://github.com/yelselmiao/Airbnb-New-User-Bookings/blob/master/Code/Naive_Bayes.Rmd): this notebook stores the codes of training and predicting with naive Bayes classifiers     
  * [3_RandomForest.Rmd](https://github.com/yelselmiao/Airbnb-New-User-Bookings/blob/master/Code/RandomForest.Rmd): this notebook stores the codes of training and predicting with random forest models    
  * [4_multinomial_logit.Rmd](https://github.com/yelselmiao/Airbnb-New-User-Bookings/blob/master/Code/multinom_logit.Rmd): this notebook stores the codes of training and predicting with multinomial logistic regression models    
  * [helper_function.R](https://github.com/yelselmiao/Airbnb-New-User-Bookings/blob/master/Code/helper_function.R): this R script contains the helper/wrapper functions of our analysis   
  * [modeling_function.R](https://github.com/yelselmiao/Airbnb-New-User-Bookings/blob/master/Code/modeling_function.R): this R script contains the helper functions specifically for the model fitting process  

* **Data**: this folder stores the data and modeling outcomes:  
  * [airbnb_cleaned.Rdata](\Data\airbnb_cleaned.Rdata): the final cleaned dataset]  
  * [rf_results.RData](\Data\rf_results.RData): the results of the random forest models, including the misclassification rates of 50% and 80% prediction interval, rate misclassification of the point prediction, AUC, and the interval score for each random forest model  
  * [rf_model_objects.RData](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ujC5eLZP8lob5y57CtPvHZrTrkW7FHor/view?usp=sharing): these are four fitted random forest model objects. Since it's too big for Github, we uploaded to Google drive. You may click on the link and download it to take a closer look at the model 
  * [rfe_1.Rdata](\Data\rfe_1.Rdata), [rfe_2.Rdata](\Data\rfe_2.Rdata), [rfe_3.Rdata](\Data\rfe_3.Rdata), [rfe_4.Rdata](\Data\rfe_4.Rdata), and [rfe_5.Rdata](\Data\rfe_5.Rdata): the random forest recursive feature elimination object for each fold  
  * [train_users_2.csv](\Data\train_users_2.csv): the original `user` dataset    
  * [session.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l24LMftgIZfgZjAno8dELdJEsGuK0mPJ/view): the original `session` dataset  

* **Figures**: some plots of visualizations  
* **Presentation**: slides of the presentation  

## How to Run the Code
To reproduce our result, please run the notebooks in the `Code` fold in the following order:   
- **1_Data_Cleaning_and_EDA.Rmd**: you may need to download the `sesson` dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/overview) and save it into the [Data](https://github.com/yelselmiao/Airbnb-New-User-Bookings/tree/master/Data) folder before running this notebook because it's too big for Github
- **2_Naive_Bayes.Rmd**: You can directly run this notebook without the need to download any files.   
- **3_RandomForest.Rmd**: Sinc running random forest models is extremely time-consuming, the objects of fitted random forest model are in  [rf_model_objects.RData](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ujC5eLZP8lob5y57CtPvHZrTrkW7FHor/view?usp=sharing); and the model summary statistics are in [rf_results.RData](\Data\rf_results.RData)
- **4_multinomial_logit.Rmd**: You can directly run this notebook without the need to download any files.
